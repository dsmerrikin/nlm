					<h3>A Message from Mark</h3>
					<img src="images/team_member_mark.jpg" alt="Mark Norwood" class="img--center">
					<p>During one of my wife's recent quests to find a trendy DIY project for us to do together, she came across the use of pallets in the yard and landscape. After looking through many photos on the internet we settled on using a pallet as a vertical planter. Later that afternoon we headed out to the shop and looked through the many stacks of pallets for the "perfect pallet"!</p>
					<p>The following morning we headed to a local nursery and picked out just the right type of flowers, ones that would grow well in the tight spaces. We started out using coco liner to fill the spaces for planting but it was a bit bulky and didn't allow much room for plant growth and roots.</p>
					<p>Luckily, Kaitlynn had some leftover burlap sitting around from our wedding reception which proved to be a much better choice. When all was said and done we had a beautiful vertical pallet planter that filled one area of our long wood fence. It really brightened up a dull area which was in desperate need of some color!</p>
					<p>The best part of this project, aside from getting my wife to work in the garden with me, is that we gave an old pallet new life! What a great way to repurpose and recycle.</p>
					<p>Check out the photos to see what we designed and watch for updated pictures on our Facebook page and future newsletters.</p>
					<p>Your feedback is always welcome!</p>
					<p>Regards,<br><b>Mark</b></p>

					<p>I was thinking the other day- thinking back about ten years ago...My brother's best friend used to constantly ask my Dad and I if he could work with us. Naturally, at the time we didn't even take him seriously, not only because he was young but at the time, he weighed less than the weed whacker he would be required to use. Ten years later, that young man has become my best friend, was my best man and the man responsible for everything that goes on in field at Norwood Landscape. That man is <b>Patrick Casey, General Manger</b> at NLC.</p>
					<p>Patrick began pulling weeds and doing whatever was asked of him and he did it well. As NLC has grown and my role has shifted a bit, Patrick is the reason that the quality of work and commitment to exceptional customer service has never wavered. Without him, and the hardworking crew that reports directly to him, we would not be where we are today, and for that I am grateful.</p>
					<p>So when you see him working on your property this summer give him a quick "Hello" and rest assured your property is in good hands with Patrick at the helm!</p>
					<p class="text-white text-center"><u>A Tip for you!</u></p>
					<p>With many spring blooming flowers and annuals coming to an end of their peak, it is a good time to consider pruning. Perennials, such as salvia, benefit greatly from trimming back the spent flowers and adding a plant fertilizer which will usually give them a repeat performance!</p>
					<p>Pruning other woody plants such as the Rhododendron, will keep them more compact and avoid the possibility of pruning away flower buds for next year.</p>
					<p>For more information about pruning trees and shrubs at your home or business contact your Norwood Landscape professional today.</p>
					<p><b>Whatever the reason, feel free to contact the G. Norwood Landscape professionals to help you!</b></p>
