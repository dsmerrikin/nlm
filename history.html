				<h2>The History of Norwood Landscape</h2>
				<p><span class="firstLetter">N</span>orwood Landscape was founded in 1979 by Gerald (Jerry) Norwood as a part-time landscape maintenance company. 
					Over the next four years Jerry worked non-stop nights and weekends growing his business. 
					By 1983 he had developed great working relationships with enough customers to leave his full-time job at Gillette and pursue his dream of running his own company. 
					Almost twenty five years later and many more relationships, Norwood Landscape has become one of the longest tenured landscape companies in the Brockton area.</p>

					As a result of our length of time in business we have been able to attract some of the finest landscape professionals in the industry.
